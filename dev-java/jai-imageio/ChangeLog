*jai-imageio-1.1-r1 (26 May 2012)

  26 May 2012; Ralph Sennhauser <sera@gentoo.org> -jai-imageio-1.1.ebuild,
  +jai-imageio-1.1-r1.ebuild:
  Upstream moved to svn, thanks to Mario Fetka <mario.fetka@gmail.com>. #252249

*jai-imageio-1.1 (22 Dec 2009)

  22 Dec 2009; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +jai-imageio-1.1.ebuild:
  New package. Needed by Audiveris, which I will add soon. Unfortunately the
  source is only available from CVS and the codec library is closed source.
  At least this ebuild is much nicer than the one in bug #252249. :)
