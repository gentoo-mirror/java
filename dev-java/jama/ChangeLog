*jama-1.0.2 (20 Dec 2009)

  20 Dec 2009; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk> +jama-1.0.2.ebuild:
  New package. Needed by Audiveris, which I hope to add soon. This is NOT the
  same as sci-libs/jama found in the science overlay, despite both being
  hosted by NIST. The other is a C++ version. See bug #53843.
