  09 May 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> j3d-core-1.5.1.ebuild:
  Bump eclipse-ecj version to 3.7 so that I can remove the older versions.
  Admittedly not tested whatsoever because the SRC_URI is broken for both this
  and vecmath and I don't have time to look into it. I very much doubt anyone
  will be trying to build this any time soon anyway.

  10 Nov 2009; Vlastimil Babka <caster@gentoo.org> -j3d-core-1.5.0.ebuild,
  -j3d-core-1.5.0-r1.ebuild, j3d-core-1.5.1.ebuild:
  Switch to ecj-3.5, so that 3.2 can be removed.

  15 Nov 2008; Vlastimil Babka <caster@gentoo.org> j3d-core-1.5.1.ebuild:
  Add ~x86.

  11 Mar 2008; Alistair Bush <ali_bush@gentoo.org> +j3d-core-1.5.1.ebuild:
  Bump to 1.5.1
