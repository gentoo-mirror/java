SwingX-WS contains a set of JavaBeans for interacting with web services. Initial
beans include support for several Yahoo and Google webservices such as searching
news, video, images, and financial data, as well as a generic tile based mapping
component (as seen in the Aerith demo at JavaOne 2006), The SwingX-WS beans have
been designed with graphical configuration in mind and work very well inside of
a JavaBeans aware editor such as NetBeans.
