*netty-transport-native-epoll-4.0.21 (31 Jan 2015)

  31 Jan 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk> +metadata.xml,
  +netty-transport-native-epoll-4.0.21.ebuild:
  New package required by minecraft-server. 4.0.25 is the current latest but
  seems to need an exact matching version of netty-transport and we only have
  4.0.21 in the tree.
