*log4j-api-2.2 (06 Mar 2015)

  06 Mar 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +log4j-api-2.2.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  The new Log4j is far more modular than version 1. This API component is
  required by the core component. I have tried to get the tests passing but I
  keep getting class cast exceptions and I can't figure out why. Even swapping
  in the upstream jars doesn't work. Perhaps Maven does some trickery that I'm
  not aware of.
