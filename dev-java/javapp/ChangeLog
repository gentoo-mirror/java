*javapp-0.4_p1 (1 Dec 2011)

  1 Dec 2011; James Le Cuirot <chewi@aura-online.co.uk>
  +javapp-0.4_p1.ebuild:
  Initial import. Depends on Python library called Plex. The .py files have
  been bundled in the JAR as upstream does because we don't seem to support
  packaging Python libraries for Jython. Tests pass. :)
