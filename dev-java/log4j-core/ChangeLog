*log4j-core-2.2 (06 Mar 2015)

  06 Mar 2015; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +log4j-core-2.2.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  The new Log4j is far more modular than version 1. This core component is
  required by minecraft-server and will no doubt become widely used. Running the
  tests is somewhat infeasible right now because they require too many packages
  that are either missing or outdated.
